# Mastermind
Run the main method in Driver.java to play. The console will then guide the user through the game.

Mastermind is a guessing game where the user will input 4 colors in a certain order. Possible options are contained in the String array "Colors" in Driver.java. Upon each guess, feedback will be provided: Quoted from Mastermind Wiki, "A colored or black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position." The user has to guess 4 colors in the correct order within 12 guesses to win the game.

#### Note: the Boolean variable revealCode in Driver.java can be set to true if one wants to see the code at the beginning to test.
